Meile dVPN GUI for Linux, OS X, and Windows - Powered by the Sentinel Network - a blockchain decentralized VPN. 

# Full Version

The full version 1.7.12 has been released to GitHub. Branches include **main**, **osx-fiat-intel**, **windows**, **fiat**, **osx-fiat**, **pip**. The exception is that we did not include the scrtsxx.py which contains credentials for the FIAT gateway. Please navigate the various branches to understand the different interworkings. It is our intention to eventually merge all branches into a unified code source. 


## Windows

The current release is version **1.7.11**. Please note this does not use Windows APIs to ask for Administration privleges and relies on an open source implementation called "gsudo". Gsudo is just a hack to ask the user to modify network adapters so that Meile may connect without hassel. 

Also, Meile opens a debug console in the background. Do not close this otherwise the app will close as well. We are working on getting a Microsoft Developers Certificate so we may sign the app for official release. Also, when we get the certificate we will eliminate the debug console as well. This is all in the works. 


Download: [Meile for Windows (v1.7.11)](https://github.com/MathNodes/meile-gui/releases/tag/v1.7.11)


## Mac OS X
Download the latest release as a DMG: [Mac OS X v1.7.11](https://github.com/MathNodes/meile-gui/releases/tag/v1.7.11)

The OS X M1/M2 and Intel builds are packaged as a disk image (DMG). To install, simply download the correct DMG for your architecture (Intel or Apple Silicon). Double click on the DMG file and move the Meile app bundle to your desktop or to the Applications folder. 

Both the OS X Intel and Apple Silicon release are signed by a Apple Developer Certificate. There should be no errors when running these. 

### NOTE:
pip install is not currently available for Mac OS X. We are working on bringing this as a separate packages. 


## Debian .deb package

The latest version of Meile GUI comes packaged as a Debian archive. Simply download the latest release: [Meile Releases](https://github.com/MathNodes/meile-gui/releases/)

and run apt for your build:

```shell
sudo apt install -y ./meile-gui-v1.7.12_ubuntu22.04_amd64.deb
```

This release will install wireguard tools, resolvconf, curl, and net-tools alongside the Meile GUI. To connect to nodes or disconnect requires "sudo" privileges. You will be prompted by your system dialog to enter your username's password to give authorization to complete the connection. This is due to how Linux handles permissions with regards to network interfaces. 

### Run

```shell
meile-gui
```

Or goto your panel menu under Internet and there will be a clickable icon. 

## Debian Virtual Machine (.deb)

Because there were issues loading certain mesa OpenGL drivers in various Debian Virtual Machines, we have included a separate .deb archive that automatically configures the system to handle the Meile dependencies. Please use this version if you are running a Debian flavor in a virutal machine (VM).

[Debian/Ubuntu 20.04 Virtual Machine](https://github.com/MathNodes/meile-gui/releases/download/v1.7.12/meile-gui-v1.7.12_ubuntu2004_amd64_vm.deb)

[Debian/Ubuntu 22.04 Virtual Machine](https://github.com/MathNodes/meile-gui/releases/download/v1.7.12/meile-gui-v1.7.12_ubuntu2204_amd64_vm.deb)

## Redhat/CentOS/Fedora (.rpm)

Download the latest RPM for RedHat releases:

[RedHat RPM (fc36)](https://github.com/MathNodes/meile-gui/releases/download/v1.7.12/meile-gui-v1.7.12-1.fc36.x86_64.rpm)

[RedHat RPM (fc37)](https://github.com/MathNodes/meile-gui/releases/download/v1.7.12/meile-gui-v1.7.12-1.fc37.x86_64.rpm)


Install the rpm from a terminal via *dnf* (**RECOMMENDED**):
```shell
sudo dnf install meile-gui-v1.7.12-1.fc36.x86_64.rpm
```

or via *rpm*:

```shell
sudo rpm -i meile-gui-v1.7.12-1.fc36.x86_64.rpm
```

*dnf* is **recommended** as it will install all dependencies for Meile to function correctly.


## Installing via pip

Meile dVPN GUI v0.14.1 is now available as a pip packages as well. These are pre-releases scheduled to be built into a binary. First install system dependencies:

```shell
sudo apt install -y  wireguard-tools openresolv mesa-utils libgl1-mesa-glx xclip python3-devel curl net-tools python3-venv
```

Then install via pip
```shell
pip3 install meile-gui
```

via a virtual environment:

```shell
mkdir ~/venv && python3 -m venv ~/venv/meile
source venv/meile/bin/activate
pip3 install meile-gui
```

Upgrade via pip

```shell
pip3 install meile-gui --upgrade
```


To run Meile GUI after pip install do the following:

```shell
meile-gui
```

### NOTE:

The FIAT gateway is not included in the pip package. This is due to certain credentials needing to remain secret for OPSEC reasons. The pip package will continue to get updated with the FIAT release in bug fixes and feature additions. 

We consider the pip releases to be pre-releases of the compiled binaries. Pip is considered the bleeding edge of Meile releases

## Creating a Binary for your distribution:

In order to create a binary for your distribution some packages need to be installed first.

Pyinstaller:
```shell
pip3 install pyinstaller
```

Install a python virtualenv:

```shell
sudo apt install python3-venv
```

Then clone the repo:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/MathNodes/meile-gui
```

Switch to the pip branch as this is the one without FIAT gateway
```
cd meile-gui && git checkout pip
```

Then run a python virtual environment and install meile-gui. This will find all the dependencies for **meile-gui**.

```shell
python3 -m venv meile-gui && \
source meile-gui/bin/activate && \ 
pip install -r requriements.txt  && pip install -e .
```

Once meile-gui and it's dependencies have been installed within the python virutal environment, a binary release can be created:

```
bash pyinstaller.cmd
```

That's it. Navigate to the `dist` folder where the binary will be. 

### Windows

For windows, install the necessary pip packages found in `setup.py` and run the following with `pyinstaller`

```shell
pyinstaller meile_gui.spec
```

This will build the binary found in the `dist` directory of the Meile tree. 

# Donations

Because we are working on a small grant with no VC funding, any additional contributions to our developer team is more than certainly welcomed. It will help fund future releases.
